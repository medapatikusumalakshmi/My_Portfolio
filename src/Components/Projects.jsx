        <p>Validating  pupilHeart  pioneering method by monitoring Heart Rate Variability on mobile devices.
        Heart disease has now become a very common and impactful disease, which can actually be easily avoided if treatment is intervened at an early stage. Thus, daily monitoring of heart health has become increasingly important.
